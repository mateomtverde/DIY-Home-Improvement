# DIY Home Improvement Website Prototype

Hello, my name is Matthew Green! This is a website prototype that I have created to help 
people interested in home improvement projects. This work in progress is being created based on knowledge gained during my short time working on my own DIY home improvement projects. I have learned by watching **_Youtube_** videos and reading content online, and also from failed attempts. 

I plan on putting time and effort into the website. I would love feedback from those who visit the website and utilize it for their home improvement projects. This will allow me to 
implement better content. Currently, the website is under construction and is a rough two page draft of what the website will include when completed.
