    <h2>Purpose of Creating The Website</h2>
    <p>My name is Matthew Green. I have been doing home improvement projects quite a bit lately.
    I have aquired a lot of knowledge in my short time doing these projects at my fiance's house.
    I decided to create this website proposal to help others who may be looking to do home improvement projects
    themselves. I want to help others avoid the pitfalls that I have encountered during my projects.
    I also want to help others find the right tools and supplies to complete their projects with ease.
