## Risk Strategy

* _Isolation_ - Impact = 4 Probability = 4 Score = 16
* _Slacking Off_ - Impact = 5 Probability = 2 Score = 10
* _Burnout_ - Impact = 3 Probability = 1 Score = 3
* _Data Insecurty_ - Impact = 5 Probability = 2 Score = 10
* _Safety and Health_ - Impact = 1 Probability = 1 Score = 1
* _Customer Relationships_ - Impact = 4 Probability = 1 Score = 4
* _Lack of Collaboration_ - Impact = 5 Probability = 2 Score = 10

I will _Mitigate_ the risk of isolation by going for a walk, going to the gym, and spending time with family members for an allotted time each day
