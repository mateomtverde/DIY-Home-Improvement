# Project Retrospective

## What Went Well?

Planning went well. I was able to observe most of the risks associated with the project and mitigate them. It allowed for a cushion on day 5 of the project to complete any necessary action items. Project scope feedback was utilized and was helpful.

## What Went Wrong?

Multiple coding errors during the building of the project proposal. Led to excessive waste of time. Internet stopped working for two days and project was held back. 

## What I Would Do Differently?

I would make sure that I have a backup internet solution. I would also start coding on day 1, since I made multiple errors that took quite a bit of time to figure out and correct.
